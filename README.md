# Domain Name System (DNS)
<p1>The purpose of DNS (Domain Name System) is to make the internet more user-friendly by translating readable domain names such as example.com into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. This allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of complex numerical addresses. Essentially, DNS acts as the internetâ€™s phonebook, ensuring that when you type a web address, you are directed to the correct website (reference, cloud flare).</p1>
