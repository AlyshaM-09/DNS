# Domain Name System (DNS)
(video tutorial here)

## <h2>What is DNS?</h2>
<p1>The purpose of DNS (Domain Name System) is to make the internet more user-friendly by translating human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. This allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of complex numerical addresses. Essentially, DNS acts as the internetâ€™s phonebook, ensuring that when you type a web address, you are directed to the correct website.</p1>
